  name: "Chulha Chawki – Food Delivery Web App",
  description:
    "I designed and developed a full-stack food delivery e-commerce web application named Chulha Chawki. The platform allows users to browse food items, add items to cart, place orders, and make secure online payments. I implemented user authentication, role-based access for admin and users, order management, and real-time order tracking. The backend APIs were built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB used for database management. Stripe was integrated for secure payment processing, and Cloudinary was used for image storage. The application focuses on performance, scalability, and a smooth user experience.",

  name: "Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System",
  description:
    "I designed and developed a real-time face recognition–based attendance system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system captures live video input through a camera, detects faces, and recognizes registered individuals to automatically mark attendance. Face data is trained using a preprocessed dataset, and attendance records are stored with timestamps for accuracy. The application reduces manual effort, prevents proxy attendance, and improves reliability. It is suitable for classrooms, offices, and organizations seeking an automated attendance solution.",

  description:
    "As part of my Data Science internship at CodSoft, I successfully completed multiple machine learning projects focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The projects include Titanic Survival Prediction (classification), Movie Rating Prediction (regression), Iris Flower Classification, and Sales Prediction. Each project involved working with real-world datasets, implementing supervised learning algorithms, evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics, and presenting insights through visualizations. These projects strengthened my understanding of end-to-end machine learning workflows and practical problem-solving.",
